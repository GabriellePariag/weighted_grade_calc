# weighted_grade_calc

This weighted grade calculator was my first personal project in Python. This application allows users to input grades they have recieved (on tests, quizzes, assignments ect.) and also input the percentage weight for the individual grades. Then, the application will calculate your total grade based on the individual grades and their weights. I started coding this program after I discovered one of my classes locked my final grade, so that I'd be unable to see it. This is meant to help students better predict their final grades.
